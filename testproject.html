    <h2>Step by step how to use Git & Github </h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Open terminal and cd into your desired directory. This is where you'll
                save your local files.
            </li>
        <br>
            <li>In Github, create a new repository and paste first code block into terminal.</li>
        <br>
            <li>After it's finished initializing, use command <em>git add -A</em> 
            or <em> git add (insert filename)</em>. Essentially, you are prepping
        your working stage before you <em>commit</em> the file.</li>
        <br> 
            <li>To check the status of your file, use command <em>git status</em>.</li>
        <br>  
            <li>At this point you, are ready to <em>commit</em> the file. To do this,
            use command <em>git commit -m "Insert short description"</em>.</li>
        <br>    
            <li>Ok, you're not finished yet. You haven't actually loaded the file into
                Github. To do this, we'll be using the command <em>git push origin master</em>
            </li>
        <br>
            <li>Voila! You're finished. Thumbs up, pat on your back, drink a swig of beer because you made it.</li>
        </ol>
